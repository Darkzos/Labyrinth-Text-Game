# Labyrinth-Text-Game
A simple game of a labyrinth in which you will have to go through many rooms until you find the exit.
The labyrinth is based on "The Shining Overlook Maze" and convert some intersections into rooms that goes around and connect each other.

The 1.0 version was the base, a simple text game without any clue, counter, restart or mixed up room names, also each choice clean the display then you can go back on your steps to see where you are, the number of rooms were 50 and that number stays on all versions, also the V1.0 has some typos and a tutorial guide. Also the number of the rooms were mixed in the screen to make it harder.

The 1.1 version fixed some typos that leads you to errors in the code.

The feedback of the V1.1 lead to create a more visual and storytelling code, the DOORS file was created to have 2, 3 or 4 doors displayed on the screen for the rooms that have that many doors, those were created in functions to make it easier to apply to the existent code.

The 1.2 version added those doors to each room, added a counter for the steps that the player made until he reach to the exit also add a restart button that wasn't added because i had troubles trying to implement it on the code, also take out the cleaning function to keep all steps on the screen displayed. 

The 2.0 version and last until now added the restart function available after some steps, asked you if you want to restart or continue, and ask you again certain number of steps later and so on until reach the max movements allowed (100) and reaches you to the start.

The game can be easily translated to english or another language, currently I'm working to make it and executable file to be played on any pc and eventually if it's possible that can be played on android phone via apk.

Any feedback it will be welcome.

Greetins!!
